Welcome to the comprehensive world of networking, where we delve deep into the realms of Enterprise, Data-center, ISP, Security, and Open-source tracks. Every lab and concept presented in this guide has been rigorously self-tested to ensure you get the most reliable and practical knowledge.

## Introduction
This guide is your gateway to mastering various networking domains, including but not limited to:

### Enterprise Networking
- **Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP)**: Dive into OSPF, EIGRP, and ISIS.
- **Multicast Technologies**: Explore PIM-ASM, PIM-SSM, Anycast-RP with MSDP, Inband-PIM, and IGMPv2 v3.
- **Dual-stack Routing**: Learn the intricacies of operating IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously.
- **Quality of Service (QoS)**: Master the art of Marking, Queueing, Policing, and Shaping.

### Security
- **Internet Key Exchange (IKE)**: Understand both IKEv1 and IKEv2.
- **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: Secure your network with robust PKI implementations.
- **VPN Technologies**: Get to grips with SVTI, DVTI, LAN to LAN IPSec VPN, GRE over IPSec, DMVPN, GETVPN, and EZVPN.

### Internet Service Providers [ISP]
- **MPLS Control-plane**: Explore OSPF, ISIS, BGP-LU, LDP, RSVP, and Segment-routing.
- **Seamless MPLS Architecture**: Ensure a smooth MPLS operation across your network.
- **BGP Route Reflectors**: Learn about IBGP RR & EBGP Route-server.
- **Advanced BGP**: Dive into BGP Tuning, IPv6 with BGP (6PE 6VPE), BGP L2VPN (VPWS VPLS), and Inter-AS MPLS architecture (Option [A-Back2Back VRF] [B-ASBR VPNv46] [C-MultiHop-RR]).

### Data Center [DC]
- **EVPN**: Master BGP L2VPN with VXLAN Encapsulation.
- **VXLAN Design**: Explore Static-tunnel, underlay PIM, and ingress-replication with BGP.
- **Multi Data Center Interconnect**: Learn the best practices for connecting multiple data centers.
- **Network Security and Load Balancing**: Implement Firewall and Load balancer solutions with Fortinet and A10.
- **Cisco VPC MLAG**: Understand the Cisco VPC MLAG deployment.

### Open Source Toolkit
- **Kubernetes CNI**: Experiment with MACVLAN, Flannel, Calico, and Cilium.
- **Kubernetes INGRESS**: Explore IPVS, ISTIO, and NGINX.
- **Kubernetes and Docker**: Dive into Kubernetes GUI, Docker with Iptables, and more.
- **Cumulus Linux and GoBGP**: Learn networking with Frrouting and GoBGP playground.
