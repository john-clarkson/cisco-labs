# Vagrant k8s IPv6-only environment

**This is a work in progress. PRs and comments are welcome.
It may also experience a rapid unscheduled disassembly (RUD) depending on the weather and the color of your shirt (was tested with blue shirts only).**

This directory contains files and scripts intended to automate the setup of the IPv6-only k8s environment described in this git repository.

The [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) environment is used to allow fast and portable setup for quick lab experiments and developments.

Note: The scripts are largely inspired by [contiv-VPP](https://github.com/contiv/vpp) plugin's vagrant environment.
